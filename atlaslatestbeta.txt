v1.7.5^v1.7.5 Greatly reduced Main Window update time. Several bug fixes and optimizations. 
- Changed: Config folder was renamed from "\Config" to "\_Config" to place config folder at top.
- Added: "Previous_Versions" Folder: On first ever run of this version, all older AtlasServerUpdateUtility_v(x).exe files will be moved to "Previous_Versions" folder and only the previous version will be moved with future auto-updates. (Thanks to Doublee and others for requesting).
- Added: Util now runs all update checks when started, but skips them if util is restarted & not due for an update check yet.
- Added: If 0 players are online, announcements are skipped during server restarts. 
- Fixed: During backups, Discord & Twitch announcements were not working correctly.
- Changed: Added more color to buttons: Red=Server Reboot, Yellow=UTIL reboot, Green=Server Start.
- Fixed: The Atlas Server Version in window title now updates with all server restarts.
