v1.9.8^v1.9.8 More minor bug fixes and improvements.
- Added: Startup logo.

- Fixed: Change Windows Priority: If enabled, it added log entries with every check.
- Fixed again: Line 44680 (or close) error due to failure to get Memory Usage of a grid.
- Changed: Status announcements & log entries: Remote grids will now show "PID [Remote]" instead of "PID []".
- Fixed: Grid Configurator: Start Server button wasn't working.
- Fixed: "Daily restart skipped..." message was being sent even if grids were restarted, if they restart process took less than one minute.
- Changed: Crash Watchdog: Added Online Player Check interval to the "Minutes to wait for RCON response before restarting grid" to prevent premature shutting down of grid.
- Fixed: Status: Sometimes the status would update before a grid was restarted, causing extra "Starting, Running, Starting" announcements.
- Added: Util Already Running Detection: Added a second detection to help eliminate duplicate starts of the util.
- Added: Discord: If "Poll Remote Servers" is enabled, then you can now decide whether to wait for all remote grids to come online before announcing all servers are online.
