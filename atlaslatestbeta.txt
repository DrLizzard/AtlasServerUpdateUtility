v1.6.7^v1.6.8 Critical Hotfix (KeepUtilAlive) and new Atlas Scheduler.
- Added: Atlas Backup with Scheduler. Still a Work In Progress: It only backs up at this time. Eventually a full recovery will be available. Also max backups not operation yet.
- Fixed: KeepUtilAlive would timeout if long mod downloads or shutdown.

v1.6.7 Hotfixes. Mod Updater now has 3rd update check method and updates when the .mod file is missing from the Atlas Mod folder.
- Added: KeepUtilAlive now checks for AtlasServerUpdateUtility crashes and hangs.
- Added: Added a third option for checking for mod updates using wget.exe to hopefully eliminate the "IE Enhanced Security Configuration" error.
- Added: The Main Window refresh rate is now user-programmable. Default is 10 seconds.
- Fixed: Line 37544 and Line 40541 errors. A parenthesis ")" was missing in a line in the upgrade process.
- Fixed: "Poll Remote Servers" was not correctly being checked at util startup.
- Fixed: If 2 or mods are updated, it would only announce the first mod being updated.
- Fixed: When a ".mod file" is deleted from the Atlas Mods folder after the util last updated the mod, it will now redownload and install the mod.
- Fixed: Servers would not restart if "Announcement _ minutes before" only had only one number.
- Fixed: When servers are restarting, the Status indicator now says "Starting" instead of "CRASHED".
