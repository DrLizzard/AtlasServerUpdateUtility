v1.9.4^v1.9.4 Hotfixes. Set priority to Low on empty grids, Fixed support for 15x15 grids, Fixed Multiple Instances
- Added: Optionally set Windows priority to low/idle on empty grids.
- Added: Option to send Grid Status updates for Local, Remote, or Both. Previously sent messages for both.
- Fixed: Start batch file: If using 64-bit version, the batch file will now update to run the 64-bit version.
- Fixed: Large ServerGrid.json files, such as the official 15x15, were too large for AutoIT to process. The util now trims the data down internally to only what it needs. This takes a little longer, but works :)
- Fixed: When starting servers, the log states restarting.
- Fixed: "Allow multiple instances of AtlasServerUpdateUtility": One section was missed when set to no.
- Fixed: KeepUtilAlive: Several bug fixes. Now restarts util like it should; properly shuts down; Text fits into window, If util paused, KeepUtilAlive also pauses.
- Fixed: Main Window: When changing from Local to Remote or vice versa, both checks marks were displaying. Unused check mark is now removed.
