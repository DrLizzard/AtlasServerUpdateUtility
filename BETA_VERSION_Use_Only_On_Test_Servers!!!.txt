----------------------------
 CURRENT BETA VERSION NOTES
----------------------------
NOTICE:
- LOG FILES, TEMP FILES, AND ONLINE PLAYERS LOG MOVED TO "\_Log\" and "\AtlasUtilFiles\" FOLDERS.
- Changed log files: It now creates two log files: One with basic info and one with full info.

	- Removed: "Server Name", "Debug", "SteamDIR", "Rotate Log Files", from config.

New features / fixes:

- Added: Option to send RCON commands/messages to select servers only.

- Changed: Moved all log files into "\_Log\" folder.
- Changed: Removed "Server Name", "Debug", "SteamDIR", "Rotate Log Files", from config.
- Changed: Hard-coded SteamCMD folder as "\SteamCMD\". to simplify installation and because sharing SteamCMD with other programs can cause issues.
- Changed: During Online Players check, if server is not ready, the util will report "-" instead of "-1" or "0".
- Fixed: Online Players log now has consistent formatting.
- Fixed: Online Players window should update without having to refresh every time.

Notes:
