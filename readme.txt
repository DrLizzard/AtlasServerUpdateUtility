More detailed features:
- Optionally execute external files for seven unique conditions, including at server updates, mod updates, scheduled restarts, remote restart, when first restart notice is announced.
  *These options are great executing a batch file to disable certain mods during a server update, to run custom announcement scripts, make config changes (enable PVP at scheduled times), etc.

-----------------
 GETTING STARTED
-----------------
NEW SERVER INSTALLATION: (Using this utility to download and install server files - STILL REQUIRES MAP (SERVERGRID.JSON) FILES - Google "how to set up an atlas dedicated server")
1) Place AtlasServerUpdateUtility.exe into any folder and run it.
- The file "AtlasServerUpdateUtility.ini" will be created and the program will exit.
2) Modify the default values in "AtlasServerUpdateUtility.ini" settings. PRIORITY SETTINGS ARE: Atlas DIR, SteamCMD DIR.
3) Run AtlasServerUpdateUtility.exe again.
- The file "AtlasServerUpdateUtilityGridStartSelect.ini" will be created. This file determines which of the grids will be started.
4) Run AtlasServerUpdateUtility.exe yet again.
- It will download and install the Atlas server files then start Atlas Dedicated Server.
- Once the BIG WHITE ERROR SCREENS start showing up, click "Exit: shutdown servers" o=in the tray icon.
5) Copy your existing ServerGrid files/folders to '.\ShooterGame' folder.
6) Run AtlasServerUpdateUtility.exe one last time.
CONGRATS! Your server should be up-to-date and running!
- If you are still having the BIG WHITE ERROR SCREENS:
  - Look at the _SERVER_SUMMARY_.txt file created by this util for any possible config errors.
  - Make sure all QueryPorts, Ports, RCONs, and DIRs are unique.. no duplicates!  These values (except RCON) are all imported from the ServerGrid.json file.
  - Set the "SeamlessIP" to your WAN (external) IP address.
  - Make sure all your ports are forwarded by your router.
  - Look for errors in the ports in the ServerGrid.json file.

EXISTING SERVER INSTALLATION:
1) Place AtlasServerUpdateUtility.exe into any folder and run it.
- The file "AtlasServerUpdateUtility.ini" will be created and the program will exit.
2) Modify the default values in "AtlasServerUpdateUtility.ini" settings. PRIORITY SETTINGS ARE: Atlas DIR, SteamCMD DIR, AltSaveDirectoryName(s) (Leave blank if you used the default 00 01 02 10 11 12 etc folder naming structure).
3) Run AtlasServerUpdateUtility.exe again.
- The file "AtlasServerUpdateUtilityGridStartSelect.ini" will be created. This file determines which of the grids will be started. Make changes as needed.
4) Run AtlasServerUpdateUtility.exe yet again.
-  It will install any updates and start the server(s).
CONGRATS! Your server should be up-to-date and running! 

--------------
 INSTRUCTIONS
-------------- 
To shut down your server:
- Click on the AtlasServerUpdateUtility (phoenix) icon in bottom right taskbar and select EXIT.

To restart your server:
- Run AtlasServerUpdateUtility.exe

To send RCON message via web browser: (Requires Remote Restart Enabled)
- Enter the link into any web browser, http://ip:port/ServerPwd@RCON_Message  ex. http://8.8.8.8:57520/AdMiN_PaSsWoRd@SaveWorld
- To send [space], use [%] without brackets.  ex. http://12.34.56.78:57520/AdMiN_PaSsWoRd@broadcast%Admin%Says%Hi

To restart your server remotely from any web browser, including your phone, see REMOTE RESTART INSTRUCTIONS below.

-----------------
 TIPS & COMMENTS
-----------------
Comments:
- Place ModIDs in ServerGrid.json only.
- If running multiple instances of this utility, each copy must be in a separate folder.
- If running multiple instances of this utility, rename AtlasServerUpdateUtility.exe to a unique name for each server. The phoenix icon in the lower right will display the filename.
  For example: I run 6 servers, so I renamed the AtlasServerUpdateUtility.exe files to Atlas-STABLE.EXE, Atlas-EXPERIMENTAL.EXE, CONAN-2X.EXE, CONAN-PIPPI.EXE, CONAN-LITMAN.EXE, & ATLAS.EXE.
- If using the "Request Restart From Browser" option, you have to use your local PC's IP address as the server's IP. ex: "Server Local IP=192.168.1.10" (127.0.0.1 and external IP do not work).
Tips:
- Use the "Run external script during server updates" feature to run a batch file that disables certain mods during a server update to prevent incompatibilities.
- External script execution for mod updates Runs the external script when mod update discovered... while server is still running.

 KNOWN BUGS
------------
### ISSUE ###
- An issue when SteamCMD does not update and validate files properly and therefore performs an update with every update check.

REASON: 
Short answer: Steamcmd is not properly put the latest "buildid" in the appmanifest.acf file after an update.
Long Answer:
- The appmanifest_1006030.acf file is created by steamcmd during updates.
- It is what my util uses to check for the latest version. It looks at the "buildid" "3594004" within that file.
- When my util notices an update is available, it renames this file (adds date & time) then runs steamcmd update again.
- When running steamcmd update, it sets "buildid" to "0" until the update is finished, then it puts the proper latest buildid there.
- For some reason, steamcmd sometimes does not replace the "0" with "3594004" (or latest number).

WORKAROUND:
- A temporary quick "fix" is to Rt-Click the AtlasServerupdateUtilkity (Phoenix) icon in bottom right and pause the utility.  It will no longer do anything, but your server(s) will stay running.
- A better workaround is:
  - Replace "D:\Game Servers\Atlas Dedicated Server\steamapps\appmanifest.acf" with a backup version that does not have the buildid as "0" in it.
  
### ISSUE ###
- Update problems when running Atlas and/or AtlasServerUpdateUtility in C:\ partition

REASON:
- It appears that Windows block certain files from being downloaded or created by AtlasServerUpdateUtility.

WORKAROUND:
- Install on another partition such as D:

 UPCOMING FEATURES
-------------------
- Second Discord webhook for admin use (announce server info into a separate Discord channel)
- html and/or PDF documentation

--------------------
 REQUESTED FEATURES  (Unknown whether they'll get added or not)
--------------------
- Cross chat (I would probably use an existing cross chat util as a "plug in" to this util)
- 7zip backups
- CPU Affinity (Reports state that Atlas itself does a job with CPU, though, so not likely add this one)
- GUI interface (will take a while to get done)
- Activate only the server start point: When it detects that a player enters a grid, automatically start surrounding grid servers.
   (Not as great as it sounds... when someone logs off of a non-home server, that server would have to remain online. Eventually, all servers would need to remain online).

---------------------------------------------
 To Create Discord Webhook for announcements
---------------------------------------------
Discord announcements are handled through Discord webhooks.
To create a Discord webhook:
- In Discord, click the Settings gear icon of the desired Discord channel.
- Click webhooks.
- Create webhook.
- Copy and paste the new URL into the AtlasServerUpdateUtility.ini as "URL ###=".
- Then save and restart the AtlasServerUpdateUtility (does NOT require server restart).

----------------------------------------------
 HOW TO USE THIS UTIL FOR MULTI-SERVER SETUPS
----------------------------------------------
( Disclaimer: I am only running a 2x2 server on a single server. I have NO experience in running larger multi-server setups.)
( The following is only my best guess as to how to use this utility on multi-server setups.)

- Use the same ServerGrid.json file on each server.
- Install and run this utility on each server.
    - On first run, it will create the file "AtlasServerUpdateUtility.ini"
    - Edit this file to match your desired server settings. It is recommended to change the following:
        Atlas DIR ###=
        Autostart and keep-alive redis-server.exe? Use NO to manage redis-server.exe yourself (yes/no) ###=no
        Server AltSaveDirectoryName(s) (comma separated. Leave blank for default 00,01,10, etc) ###=	
            a. Type in the folder names of ALL servers here, including folders for remote servers.
              (This util pairs each folder entry to each server listed in ServerGrid.json, therefore even folders not used on the local server need to be entered) *OR*
            b. Leave this blank [recommended] and change your existing folders to match this util's default assignment: (00 10 20 30 01 02 03 etc.)
- Run the utility again to create the AtlasServerUpdateUtilityGridStartSelect.ini file.  This file is used to determine which grid servers start on the local server.
    - Edit this file. Type "no" to any of the grids being run on remote servers. The local server will only run the grids marked as "yes".

Below is an example of how to have this utility start your existing redis server:
- Create a batch file in the following folder (the util's default external script folder):
    D:\Game Servers\Atlas Dedicated Server\Scripts\beforesteamcmd.bat
    Edit beforesteamcmd.bat and include the following (changing it to point to your existing redis-server file, of course!)
        start cmd /k Call D:\Game Servers\Atlas Dedicated Server\AtlasTools\RedisDatabase\redis-server_start.bat 3333
- Edit AtlasServerUpdateUtility.ini as follows:
    [--------------- EXECUTE EXTERNAL SCRIPT BEFORE SteamCMD UPDATE AND SERVER START ---------------]
    1-Execute external script BEFORE update? (yes/no) ###=yes
    1-Script directory ###=D:\Game Servers\Atlas Dedicated Server\Scripts
    1-Script filename ###=beforesteamcmd.bat

-----------------------------
 REMOTE RESTART INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------------
====> Request Restart From Browser <====
- If enabled on the server, use to remotely restart the server (for multiple system setups).
- When restarting, an announcement will be made in-game, on Discord, and in Twitch if enabled, with the set duration of delay (warning).
- Set Password in INI file to save, or type each time.
- Restart using IP or Domain Name
- Restart commands are now expecting HTTP headers, and can be sent to the server from a web browser using the format http://IP:PORT?restart=user_pass. The utility will respond if the password is accepted or not. There is also a limit for max password attempts. After 15 tries in 10 minutes the requesting IP will be locked out for 10 minutes.
- 404 Responses will be sent if the RestartKey does not match or the header is incorrect. You can enable Debugging for a full output to the log what is being received by the server if you have any trouble.
- These Are the Allowed Characters in the RestartCode (Password) 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!@$%^&*()+=-{}[]\|:;./?

Usage Example:
INI SETTINGS
[Game Server IP]
ListenIP=192.168.0.1
[Use Remote Restart ?yes/no]
UseRemoteRestart=yes
[Remote Restart Request Key http://IP:Port?RestartKey=RestartCode (Ex: 192.168.1.30:57520?restart=password)]
ListenPort=57520
RestartKey=restart
RestartCode=password

- You can have multiple passwords. For example: RestartCode=password1,pass2,pwd3
In a standard web browser, type in the URL http://192.168.1.30:57520?restart=password. The Server would compare the pass and find that it is correct. It would respond with 200 OK And HTML Code stating the server is restarting.

 Questions & Answers  Q&A from commonly asked questions
---------------------
(WORK IN PROGRESS)
What changes does the utility make to the Atlas GameUserSettings.ini, Game.ini, etc. files?
- The utility makes no direct changes to any of Atlas' config files. Anything added to the "Atlas extra commandline parameters ###=" will get added by Atlas itself.

How does the utility shut down the servers?
- I removed the SaveWorld command because it wasn't working last time I checked.  The DoExit and CTRL-X both force a SaveWorld ... I've tested them quite a bit. Even if the RCON ports are wrong, the CTRL-X should safely shutdown servers. 

--------------------------------------------------------
 FYI: DETAILS OF HOW THIS UTIL PERFORMS CERTAIN ACTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------

 INFORMATION ON IMPORTING DATA (Details on what information is imported and how it is used)
-------------------------------
The following information is imported from the ServerGrid.json:
 (All servers)
    "totalGridsX" - Used in combination with totalGridsY to calculate total number of servers.
    "totalGridsY" - Used in combination with totalGridsX to calculate total number of servers.
 (Each server)
    "ip"          - Used to determine each server's IP address (In command line, sent as 'SeamlessIP=')
    "port"        - Used to determine each server's port       (In command line, sent as 'QueryPort=')
    "gamePort"    - Used to determine each server's gameport   (In command line, sent as 'Port=')
 
The following information is imported from each grid server's GameUserSettings.ini (when available):
    "RCONPort"    - Used to determine each server's RCON port  (In command line, sent as 'RCONEnabled=True?RCONPort=')

The grid servers are started in the order they are listed in the ServerGrid.json file.

Here's how the utility imports and assigns folders, ports, grids, etc.:
- It opens the ServerGrid.json file and uses the "totalGridsX" and "totalGridsY" to calculate the total number of servers.
- Next, it skips to "servers": [ "
- Then reads theÂ first "gridX" , "gridY" , "ip" , "port" , "gamePort".
- It then assigns the first folder listed under "Server AltSaveDirectoryName(s)" in AtlasServerUpdateUtility.ini to that server. The first server's information is now complete.
It then repeats this process for the remainder of the servers listed in the ServerGrid.json file.
- The utility continues to import the data for each server listed in ServerGrid.json, even if the server isn't used or is disabled.

 METHOD USED FOR UPDATING MODS (Details on how mods are downloaded and checked for updates)
-------------------------------
At very first run of the util, all mods will be downloaded and installed. This is necessary to create temp file(s) used to determine current version of each mod.
- The util downloads another util I created, AtlasModDownloader.exe, to perform the downloading and updating. (Python was much better at uncompressing the .z files than AutoIT).
- Each mod is updated one-at-a-time. AtlasModDownloader uses SteamCMD to download new mod content, move the folder content to ../content/mods folder, uncompress the .z files, then delete the SteamCMD cache folder.
- The app_manifest file created by SteamCMD will then be renamed and moved to the Util folder. This what my util uses to determine current installed version.

For update checks:
- The util goes to this website: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/[MODID] to check for latest version.
- It then reads the mod_[MODID]_appworkshop.tmp (created each time a mod is downloaded) and compares the two. If the same, it skips.
- If different buildid, it reruns the AtlasModDownloader.exe program again which redownloads and installs the mod.
- It then makes any announcements (ingame, Discord, Twitch) and will restart all servers when the announcement times are fulfilled.

- Changed: debug = yes by default.
- Removed: "Mods are up to date" log entry unless mods are truly up-to-date.

- Fixed: When update check fails to get latest version, a warning message is displayed but the utility continues to function and check for updates. Previously it would run close servers and perform SteamCMD update loops.
- Fixed: If update needed at utility start, utility immediately begins update. Previously, it would wait until next update check.
- Fixed: If SteamCMD or SteamDB detected server out of date, it waited until next update check.
- Changed: Improved wording for SteamDB update check to make the "Must use Internet Explorer" requirement more prominent.

(2019-02-13) v1.0 Initial Release
- Works with 1-4 grids on same computer only.
- OK to use with most other server managers: Use this tool to install and maintain the server and use your other tools to manage game play features.
- Automatically download and install a new Atlas Dedicated Server: No need to do it manually.
- Automatically keeps server updated.
- Announce server updates and/or restarts in game, on Discord and Twitch.
- KeepServerAlive: Detects server crashes (checks for AtlasGame.exe and telnet response) and will restart the server.
- User-defined scheduled reboots.
- Remote restart (via web browser).
- Run multiple instances of AtlasServerUpdateUtility to manage multiple servers.
- Clean shutdown of your server(s).
More detailed features:
- Optionally execute external files for six unique conditions, including at updates, scheduled restarts, remote restart, when first restart notice is announced
  *These options are great executing a batch file to disable certain mods during a server update, to run custom announcement scripts, make config changes (enable PVP at scheduled times), etc.
- Can validate files on first run, then optionally only when buildid (server version) changes. Backs up & erases appmanifest.acf to force update when client-only update is released by The Fun Pimps.
