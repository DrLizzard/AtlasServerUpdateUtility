v2.2.1^v2.2.1 New! User-Defined Windows Defender Port Blocking Delay. Minor Bug Fixes.
- Added: Firewall Delay. Optionally block Windows Firewall ports after select grids started for user-defined seconds. Useful to prevent crashes when players connect while stacking mods are still processing.
- Added: Log Window: "Open File" to all files in the log file window.
- Fixed: Grid Configurator: Fixed editor window sizes to fit main window
- Fixed: Server Updates: When polling remote servers, ASUU would sometimes start countdown but not update/restart on first attempt.
- Fixed: Parameter: Changed bAutoGenerateIslandSpawnRegions to AutoGenerateIslandSpawnRegions (removed the 'b')
- Fixed: Grid Configurator: "Stop Server" button now uses new stop window.
- Fixed: When stopping a grid with no online players, the Discord announcement was using old default instead of replacing /g with grid(s).
- Fixed: Discord Status Updates: ASUU was not sending status updates if first grid was disabled
- Fixed: Discord Status Updates: If more than one webhook was selected for status updates, duplicate messages were sent.
