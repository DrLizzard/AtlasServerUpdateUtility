- Fixed: Line x error when using Send RCON clicked.

- Added: Restart Now button now asks if you want to send a Discord announcement.
- Changed: Restart Now now restarts the servers immediately instead of waiting the default 10 seconds for the main window to refresh.
- Fixed: When shutting down servers from main window, the "Atlas servers online and ready for connection" Discord message would send.
